# sbaReact3.0
Accidentally repo the sba-react so i had to create another repo for the backend/server side 
I will have both repo links uploaded for use
This is just a basic layout of what my capstone will be 
there is functionality with the home page with a gallery using useState and use Effect
you can click on the shopping cart image that will take you to checkout
when you click on purchase it takes you to stripe check out where you can use dummy info 
ex:
email: domain@email.com
card number: 4242 4242 4242  4224
exp: 01/27
cvv: 123
country: choose any country
once you click checkout it will redirect you to a success page from the frontend
